**Checkout original Medium article ["Flutter: Building Wear OS app"](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-building-wearos-app-fedf0f06d1b4).**

This is an app for Wear OS devices which is inspired from the Medium article written 
by [Matt Sullivan](https://medium.com/@mjohnsullivan), 
["Experimenting with Flutter on Wear OS"](https://medium.com/@mjohnsullivan/experimenting-with-flutter-on-wear-os-f789d843f2ef). 
This article really helped me to understand, how to manage the screen size of the app properly and inheriting it to different classes.

In this app, I tried to optimize the [relax](https://github.com/erinmorrissey/relax) app created by Erin Morrissey 
(made as a Flutter Create Submission 2019, which got nominated for Visual Beauty), to run on Wear OS devices.

The wear app has two modes:
1) Normal Mode
2) Ambient Mode (which is the battery saving mode)
